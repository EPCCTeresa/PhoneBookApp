* Ruby version
3.0.2

* Installation
Download this repo by using git clone command and execute in your local machine:

$ bundle install

* Execution
After downloading and installing the proyect, let's execute the server by running

$ rails s
Now the server is ready to receive petitions. There are two options:

- Go to a web browser and use the url: http:/localhost::3000. The user will be able to follow the flow of the app then.

- Use a HTTP client and make a GET call to the url: http://localhost:3000/


* Improvements
- Make the UX more user friendly, according to current front frameworks
- Tests
- Provide the possibility to filter the listed records in order to avoid overloading the visual information that the end user receives from the Web App.
